### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned

Better understanding of HTML and CSS. First project with JS to help with un-hiding thank you component. DOM manipulation is not as easy, but with plenty of practice and googling. It will happen.

### Continued development

I need to figure out how to add to the functionality that the ratings must be selected forst before submission. I will need to further investigate.
